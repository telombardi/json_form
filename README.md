# json_form
 The code provides a simple example of saving form data as a json file on a server.
 
 The example includes the following components:
 1. **index.html** defines the GUI components of a form
 2. **script.js** defines the Javascript function that converts the form data to JSON.
 3. **style.css** defines the look and feel of the HTML page with CSS
 4. **hander.php** accepts the POST data from script.js and saves the file via PHP to the server's file system.
 
 Components 1,2 & 3, based on the codepen in the references section, will largely work by themselves from a properly configured Apache2 server.
 Component 4 requires PHP and a properly configured Apache2 server.
